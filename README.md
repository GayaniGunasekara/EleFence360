Version 1.0 of The Automated Elephant Detection and Deterrence System for Enhanced Elephant Fencing
# 🐘 Elefence360
Elefence360 is IoT based Elephant Detection & Deterrence System  developed to prevent human-elephant conflicts, protect agricultural land, and ensure elephant safety. This system uses an ESP-32 microcontroller with relevant sensors to detect elephants using ground vibrations and triggers a sound-based deterrent when activity is sensed. This is a non harmful detterent sound specially tuned for elephants hearing rang. The system is integrated with a mobile app that provides real-time alerts and data visualization. In addition to monitoring the electricity flow in the fence, it also detects any physical damages or disruptions to the fence structure, ensuring continuous status updates and enhancing overall system reliability.

## 🚀 Features
🔍 Accuratly Detect Elephant Presence Using Vibration Sensors.

🔊 Humance Deterrence with elephant-sensitive sound waves.

📱 Provide Real-Time Alerts via Mobile Application to villages and relavant authorities.

⚡ Monitor Fence Status (Electrification and physical Damages).

📍 Map Threat Zones to identify high-risk areas.
