**üêò EleFence360 ‚Äì Smart Elephant Intrusion Detection & Alert System
**

EleFence360 is an intelligent IoT-based solution to detect and deter elephants, monitor elephant electric fences, and enhance awareness among people and relevant authorities. The system integrates IoT, sensor technology, and a mobile application to reduce human-elephant conflict, property damage, and casualties.

üöÄ Overview
Human-elephant conflict (HEC) is a significant issue in many rural areas, often leading to crop destruction, infrastructure damage, and even loss of life for both humans and elephants.

EleFence360 provides a real-time monitoring and alert system that:

Detects elephant movements near electric fences

Monitors fence integrity

Immediately notifies relevant authorities and villagers through a mobile app

System Methodology: Detection ‚Üí Deterrence ‚Üí Monitoring ‚Üí Real-time Data Communication

Detection

Ground vibrations (indicating elephant movement)

Electric fence voltage status (detecting power loss or failure)

Fence post tilts or movements (possible intrusion points)

Deterrence

Sound Deterrence: Activates non-harmful repellent sounds to repel elephants

Monitoring & Real-Time Data Communication

Once a threat is detected, real-time alerts are sent to stakeholders, including:

Local villagers

Wildlife department

Electricity board

Nearest railway station

Each alert contains the incident-triggered time, date, and actual location (Google Maps), displaying threat areas on the app map interface.
